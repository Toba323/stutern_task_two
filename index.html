         <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil <b></b>peeled beans </b>with enough water over medium heat until soft or use a pressure cooker both stove top or electric pressure cooker works.</li>
                <li>Boil <b>assorted meat</b> till tender with <b>beef stock cubes, onions and salt.</b> Separate stock from meat and set aside</li>
                <li>Blend cooked beans in a blender for a smooth puree and set aside, pass the blended through a tiny hole sieve and discard the chaff.</li>
                <li>Place a pan on medium heat, add <b>palm oil and heat for about 3 minutes </b>(don’t bleach oil)</li>
                <li>Stir puréed beans in palm oil (beans purée should not be loose but somewhere in the middle of loose and thick) Add water if needed to achieve the desired thickness</li>
                <li>Add assorted beef (if using) and cayenne pepper, stir till well combined. Reduce the heat and leave to cook for about 10 minutes. Check-in between to avoid soup from burning and add more water if need be</li>
                <li>Add ground crayfish, beef stock cube and salt. At this point don’t want the soup to be thick, add water if need be but don’t overdo it. Continue to cook for another 3 minutes then take it off the heat. Serve with ewedu soup, swallow of choice like amala dudu (yam flour), garri or Tuwo and buka stew</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>If you don’t have a blender, use ijabe (the small broom used for cooking) or cook the beans until mushy and pass through the sieve as you would with a blender method.</p>
            <p>Gbegiri is mostly cooked with meat or other protein, so feel free to cook it plain with crayfish alone and pair with buka stew.</p>
